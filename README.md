Sayan's Fruit Crush is a premium and high-octane Match-3 puzzle game designed for seamless play on both mobile devices and personal computers. Developed by Sayan Das, the game offers a visually rich experience characterized by tropical fruit graphics, juicy physics animations, and a vibrant instrumental soundtrack. The game interface is built to adapt dynamically to any screen size, providing a full-screen cinematic feel that remains consistent across all platforms.

The core gameplay centers on the strategic swapping of fruits within an eight-by-eight grid. Players must follow a strict adjacency rule where a fruit can only be swapped with a neighbor directly above, below, or to either side. This movement is limited to a single-box distance, meaning players cannot drag items across the board. If a swap does not lead to a match of at least three identical items, the fruits will automatically slide back to their starting positions with a smooth animation.

Matches are formed by aligning three or more identical fruits in a horizontal or vertical line. When a match is successfully made, those fruits are blasted from the board with a satisfying sound effect and visual pop. This creates empty spaces that are immediately filled as fruits from above fall down with a bouncy effect. This cascading mechanic allows for chain reactions where one move can trigger multiple consecutive matches and significantly increase the player's score.

Strategy becomes more complex when players create special power-ups by matching larger groups of fruits. Aligning four identical fruits in a single line produces a Red Bomb which grants a three-times coin multiplier upon detonation. Even more powerful is the Black Bomb, which is earned by aligning five identical fruits. When a player swipes the Black Bomb with any adjacent fruit, every instance of that specific fruit type is instantly wiped from the entire grid, providing a massive surge in points and board clearance.

Each game session operates under a strict two-minute challenge requiring players to think and move quickly. Every fruit destroyed adds coins to a persistent wallet which is saved directly to the browser's local storage. When the one hundred and twenty second timer reaches zero, the game presents a final summary of coins collected and advances the player to the next level. This leveling system ensures that progress is saved so players can continue their journey toward high scores whenever they return to the website.

This game was meticulously crafted by Sayan Das to showcase advanced artificial intelligence development techniques and high-performance web optimization. The integration of premium sound effects, responsive design, and smooth frame rates ensures an engaging user experience from start to finish.
